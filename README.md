# Ping-Pong Game
Python Game using Turtle Graphics

Pong is a classic arcade game,probably one of the first arcade games that ever was. And it has a really simple premise. It's basically just a ball
that's going across a table and two players each control a paddle bouncing the ball back and forth. If you miss the ball,then the other player scores a point.
First, I figured out how to create the screen, how to create and move a puddle, and then create another puddle so I can have a two-player game and then create the ball and make it move constantly across the screen and figure out when it collides with a wall and make it bounce back and then detect when there's a collision with the paddle to know when to bounce it back. Finally, I figured out when a user scores,when the paddle misses the ball, and we'll keep the score using a scoreboard at the top.
